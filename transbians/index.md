1. No ERP. Direct everything of that nature to #thelewdtransbians
2. Tag any external links that's NSFW
3. Be respectful of everyone and their beliefs, no flamewars or fighting
4. This is a channel for lesbians. Even though a huge chunk of us are bi, keep your >tfw no precum soaked penis comments to yourself
5. Please refrain from encouraging suicide or self harm, m'kay?
6. #transbians is meant to be a safe place. If anyone says they feel uncomfortable about something you're doing, **then please stop**
    
Note that talk of genitalia is fine, as long as it's related to transitioning. Please refrain from comments such as "Oohhh, my dick is soo huge and great hnnng"

**If there's anything else you can think of, need to complain about the above, or just need clarification, /msg Maryth when she's on**
